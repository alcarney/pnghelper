# PNG: A helper libaray

This library acts as a helper library to libpng a common way to interact with
png files and provides many useful abstractions, allowing the user to focus on
their current project and not have to deal with the paritculars of image loading
etc.

# Current Features

Currently (v0.1) this library supports the following features:

    - Saving and loading of PNG images 
    - Provides an easy way to iterate over the pixels in an image and perform operations on them

# Planned Features

Umm we need to start thinking about what should go here, maybe trying to use the libaray as it is
would be a good way to find its limitations and where improvements could be made.
